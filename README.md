Proof of Concept Instructions
Project Overview:

Goal: To create a software solution that uses a smartphone's sensors (sound sensor and accelerometer) to emulate mouse movements and clicks, connecting to a laptop via Bluetooth.
Required Technologies:

Smartphone App: Develop an app compatible with Android (expandable to iOS later) that uses the device's accelerometer and microphone to detect movements and vibrations or sounds for clicks.
Laptop Application: A desktop application that can communicate with the smartphone app via Bluetooth, interpreting the sensor data into cursor movements and mouse clicks.
Development Steps:

Sensor Data Acquisition: Code to access and read accelerometer and sound sensor data in real-time from the smartphone.
Movement and Click Detection Algorithms: Implement algorithms to interpret sensor data into specific commands (move cursor, left-click, right-click).
Bluetooth Communication: Establish a reliable Bluetooth connection between the smartphone and the laptop for data transmission.
Cursor Control on Laptop: Develop the laptop application to receive sensor data and translate it into cursor movements and mouse actions.
Testing and Validation:

Conduct extensive testing to ensure accurate interpretation of movements and clicks, with adjustments for sensitivity and accuracy.
Validate the Bluetooth connection stability and responsiveness of the system in different environments.
User Interface (UI) Design:

Design intuitive UIs for both the smartphone app and laptop application, focusing on ease of connection and configuration options for users.
